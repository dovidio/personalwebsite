## Work
I'm working for [Paysafe](https://www.paysafe.com/), a company focusing on online payments.
Most of my work involves Java, Javascript, and SQL.

## Free time
I spend my free time running, reading, and refreshing [this page](https://coronavirus.jhu.edu/map.html) quite often.

## Music
Here's a couple of songs that I'm listening on repeat [Subsonica - Di Domenica](https://open.spotify.com/track/1GNVQ89D3nbDLagaWlU6d1?si=eHidPRtSQLO7PxX6eokJyQ),
[NTO - Trauma](https://open.spotify.com/track/4jTlhnW8wp7ANU36iRgbQK?si=D0drD7kqQwGRrG09CvmIDg),
[Rupert Holmes - Escape](https://open.spotify.com/track/5I9zIwGB6f0edpjO5oX2b9?si=WB5v3fBCQGuOnDmER-rVSw).

## Books
Last book I've read (actually listened to) is [Can't Hurt Me: Master Your Mind and Defy the Odds](https://www.amazon.com/Cant-Hurt-Me-David-Goggins-audiobook/dp/B07KKP62FW), probably
the best audiobook you can listen to while running.
I am currently reading [Why we sleep: Unlocking the Power of Sleep](https://www.amazon.com/Why-We-Sleep-Unlocking-Dreams/dp/1501144316) and [Extreme Ownership: How U.S. Navy SEALs Lead and Win](https://www.amazon.com/Extreme-Ownership-U-S-Navy-SEALs-ebook/dp/B00VE4Y0Z2).

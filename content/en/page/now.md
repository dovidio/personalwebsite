## Work
I'm lucky to contribute to the [Kubernetes monitoring dashboard]((https://www.dynatrace.com/technologies/kubernetes-monitoring/)) along with some amazing colleagues at Dynatrace. I'm working mostly with Java and Angular.

## Free time
Summer is here, and with it also extreme trekking, bike trips and desperate german learning sessions.

## Music
I have rediscovered this masterpiece: [Devin Townsend - Ziltoid the Omniscient](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YjSKoG1zWPa3Ooa2tmkpy?si=qnSyCG8ET2yh0lqiOfcQ2A).

## Books
I have just finished [**Kubernetes Up and Running**](https://www.amazon.com/Kubernetes-Running-Dive-Future-Infrastructure/dp/1492046531/ref=dp_ob_title_bk). Next one is going to be [**Hands-On Software Engineering with Golang**](https://www.amazon.com/Hands-Software-Engineering-Golang-programming-dp-1838554491/dp/1838554491/ref=mt_paperback?_encoding=UTF8&me=&qid=/).

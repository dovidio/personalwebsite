## Work
I'm lucky to contribute to the Kubernetes monitoring dashboard along with some amazing colleages at Dynatrace. I'm working mostly with Java and Angular.

## Free time
Summer is here, and with it also extreme trekking, bike trips and desperate german learning sessions.

## Music
I have rediscovered this masterpiece: [Devin Townsend - Ziltoid the Omniscient](https://open.spotify.com/album/6YjSKoG1zWPa3Ooa2tmkpy?si=qnSyCG8ET2yh0lqiOfcQ2A).

## Books
I have just finished **Kubernetes Up and Running**. Next one is going to be **Software Engineering with Golang**.

## Work
I'm working for [Paysafe](https://www.paysafe.com/), a company focusing on online payments.
Most of my work involves Java, Javascript, and SQL.

## Free time
I spend my free time running, reading, blogging, learning german and working on side projects.

## Music
A couple of pearls I've recently discovered:
- [Bag Raiders - Sunlight](https://open.spotify.com/track/0UJSqvoNqME71nlzSa3H7E)
- [Gino Soccio - Dancer](https://open.spotify.com/track/4lteGaLzU5veJOe6wnOvz4)
- [M83 - Hell Riders](https://open.spotify.com/track/5SrF0wLZZq1gbG71amy8uU)

## Books
I'm currently getting deeper into Quarkus and I can recommend this wonderful fascicle from Antonio Goncalves: https://developers.redhat.com/books/understanding-quarkus

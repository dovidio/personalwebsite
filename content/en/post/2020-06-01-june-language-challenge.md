I've been struggling with learning german for a couple of years.
I've tried multiple techniques and content types: apps, structured language courses, informal tutoring on [italki](https://www.italki.com/),
and yet I'm still far from fluency. Recently I've discovered [lingvist](https://lingvist.com), an app that claims to use the
best findings in cognitive research to improve learning retention.
It's basically some sort of glorified [Anki](https://apps.ankiweb.net/), targeted
specifically to language learning.

As with most apps, I haven't been to consistent with my usage, but I want to force myself to give it a try.
At the moment the apps tells me I have learned 1232 words.

I commit to go through 100 cards per day, for 30 days. I will post my progress and my consideration on this method of learning at the end of
the 30 days. Stay tuned for more, and consider joining me in this challenge!
